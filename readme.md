# Switcheo Code Challenge

This is my attempt for the the Switcheo Code Challenge as part of my application to Switcheo as a backend engineer.

## My Thoughts

I definitely enjoyed myself with the challenge and loved how it got me to learn quite a chunk of new things within such a short period of time. The problems provided a great exposure to the techonologies used in web3 development and picking up the basics was an eye opening experience. I honestly wasn't sure of what to expect from this challenge, but I somehow ended up deploying my first ever smart contract in the process, soo this was pretty cool I guess!
